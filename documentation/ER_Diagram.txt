LEGEND:
PK = Primary Key
FK = Foreign Key
---> = One-to-Many Relationship

RELATIONSHIPS:
1. One user can have one student_profile (1:1)
2. One user can have one company_profile (1:1)
3. One user can have one college_profile (1:1)
4. One company_profile can post many internships (1:N)
5. One student_profile can submit many applications (1:N)
6. One internship can receive many applications (1:N)
7. One college_profile can track many students through college_students (1:N)
8. One student_profile can be associated with many colleges through college_students (1:N)
9. student_profiles and college_profiles have a many-to-many relationship implemented through the college_students table
10. student_profiles and internships have a many-to-many relationship implemented through the applications table

CARDINALITY CONSTRAINTS:
- A student can apply to a specific internship only once (enforced by unique constraint on internship_id, student_id)
- A student can be associated with a specific college only once (enforced by unique constraint on college_id, student_id)
- When a user is deleted, associated profiles are also deleted (cascade delete)
- Internship status must be one of: 'open', 'closed', or 'filled' (enum constraint)
- Application status must be one of: 'pending', 'shortlisted', 'rejected', or 'selected' (enum constraint)
- Verification status must be one of: 'pending', 'verified', or 'rejected' (enum constraint)
- User type must be one of: 'student', 'company', 'college', or 'admin' (enum constraint)
