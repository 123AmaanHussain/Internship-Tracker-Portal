   - Profile creation and management
   - Role-based access control

2. **For Students**
   - Profile creation with educational details and skills
   - Resume upload and management
   - Internship discovery and application
   - Application status tracking
   - Recommended internships based on skills and preferences

3. **For Companies**
   - Company profile management
   - Internship posting and management
   - Applicant review and selection
   - Analytics on application trends
   - Communication with applicants

4. **For Administrators/Colleges**
   - Student verification and management
   - Company verification
   - Campus drive organization
   - Placement statistics and reporting
   - System monitoring and management

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React.js
  - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
  - Component-based architecture for reusable UI elements
  - Virtual DOM for efficient rendering

- **State Management**
  - React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
  - Context API for global state management

- **Routing**
  - React Router for navigation between components
  - Protected routes for authentication

- **UI Components**
  - Bootstrap for responsive design
  - Custom CSS for styling
  - Bootstrap Icons for iconography

- **HTTP Client**
  - Axios for API communication
  - Interceptors for request/response handling

- **Data Visualization**
  - Chart.js for analytics and reporting visualizations

### Backend

- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js
  - JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
  - Event-driven, non-blocking I/O model

- **Web Framework**: Express.js
  - Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework
  - Middleware support for request processing
  - Routing for API endpoints

- **Authentication**
  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication
  - Bcrypt for password hashing
  - Role-based access control

- **File Handling**
  - Multer for file uploads (resumes, profile pictures)
  - File storage management

- **Validation**
  - Express-validator for input validation
  - Custom middleware for request validation

### Database

- **Database Management System**: Oracle 11g
  - Relational database for structured data storage
  - Strong ACID compliance
  - Advanced query capabilities

- **ORM/Database Access**
  - node-oracledb for Oracle database connectivity
  - Connection pooling for efficient database access
  - Parameterized queries for security

- **Database Design**
  - Normalized schema design (3NF)
  - Foreign key constraints for data integrity
  - Indexes for query optimization

### Development Tools

- **Version Control**
  - Git for source code management
  - GitHub/GitLab for repository hosting

- **Code Quality**
  - ESLint for code linting
  - Prettier for code formatting

- **Development Environment**
  - Visual Studio Code as IDE
  - npm for package management
  - Nodemon for automatic server restarts during development

- **Testing**
  - Jest for unit testing
  - React Testing Library for component testing

## System Architecture

The Digital Internship & Placement Portal follows a three-tier architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer (Frontend)**
   - React.js components for UI
   - Client-side routing and state management
   - Responsive design for multiple devices

2. **Application Layer (Backend)**
   - Express.js REST API
   - Business logic implementation
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Data validation and processing

3. **Data Layer (Database)**
   - Oracle 11g database
   - Data persistence and retrieval
   - Data integrity enforcement

### API Communication

- RESTful API design principles
- JSON data format for request/response
- HTTP status codes for response status
- Token-based authentication for secure API access

## Database Schema

The database consists of five main entities:

1. **USERS**: Central authentication table for all user types
2. **STUDENTS**: Detailed information about student users
3. **COMPANIES**: Detailed information about company users
4. **INTERNSHIPS**: Internship opportunities posted by companies
5. **APPLICATIONS**: Student applications for internships

Refer to the ER diagram and schema documentation for detailed information about the database structure.

## Deployment

The application can be deployed using:

- **Frontend**: Static file hosting (Netlify, Vercel, or AWS S3)
- **Backend**: Node.js hosting (Heroku, AWS EC2, or Azure App Service)
- **Database**: Oracle Cloud, AWS RDS, or on-premises Oracle server

## Security Considerations

- Password hashing using bcrypt
- JWT with appropriate expiration
- HTTPS for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection)
- Rate limiting for API endpoints

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Notifications**
   - WebSocket integration for instant updates
   - Email notifications for important events

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Predictive analytics for placement trends
   - Recommendation engine improvements

3. **Mobile Application**
   - Native mobile apps for iOS and Android
   - Push notifications

4. **Integration Capabilities**
   - API for integration with college ERP systems
   - Calendar integration for interviews and events

5. **Enhanced Search**
   - Full-text search for internships
   - Advanced filtering options
